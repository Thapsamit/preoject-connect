This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

# Questions regarding Next js

- What is Next Js?

- Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that is used for building modern web applications. It is often associated with React, but it can work with other front-end libraries or frameworks as well. Next.js is particularly known for its focus on server-rendered React applications and its developer-friendly features
- Features
  - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js enables server-side rendering, which means that the initial rendering of a web page occurs on the server, and the server sends HTML to the client's browser. This can improve performance and SEO, as search engines can easily crawl the content.
  - **Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js** automatically splits your code into smaller bundles, so only the necessary JavaScript code is loaded for a particular page, improving load times and overall performance.
  - **File-Based Routing:** Next.js offers a file-based routing system, where you create pages by adding files to a "pages" directory. The route structure is based on the file system, which simplifies routing and navigation in your application.
  - **API Routes:** It provides built-in support for creating API routes, allowing you to create serverless functions and RESTful APIs within your Next.js application.
  - **Static Site Generation (SSG):** In addition to SSR, Next.js supports static site generation, where pages are pre-rendered at build time and served as static HTML files. This is useful for content that doesn't change often and can be cached for optimal performance.
  - **Hot Module Replacement:** Next.js supports hot module replacement, which allows developers to see the immediate results of code changes without a full page reload, making development more efficient.
  - **CSS Support:** Next.js offers built-in support for CSS modules, styled-jsx, and other styling solutions, simplifying the management of styles for your components.
  - **Custom Server and Middleware:** You can use custom server logic and middleware with Next.js, allowing you to extend and customize the server behavior.
  - **TypeScript Support:** Next.js is compatible with TypeScript, which provides strong typing and helps catch errors at compile time.
